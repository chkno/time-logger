A simple time-tracking tool

The killer feature of this tool: The backing store of the information collected and displayed by this tool is a simple text file.  Inevitably, you will forget to log something, make a typo, etc. and want to edit the log to correct it.  With this tool, you can use the full power and comfort of your favorite $EDITOR.
